# Semi Streaming Maximum Matching - Spring 2023 COS IW 07 Project

Implementations of approximate maximum cardinality matching algorithms in the semi-streaming model.

* ALT.java is an implementation of the algorithm described in https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611976472.18
* McGregor.java is an implementation of the algorithm described in https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mcgregor/papers/05-approx1.pdf

This project makes substantial use of the JGraphT library (https://jgrapht.org/).
